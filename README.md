# Sentence Case Fixer — Debugging Challenge

This challenge is designed to test a candidate’s ability to spot subtle JavaScript bugs and UX issues in a simple app that converts input text into sentence case.

---

## Instructions
* Clone/download the repo
* Open in a code editor
* Copy path of the index file
* Open in a browser window

## What the app should do

- Accept a text input from the user.
- Convert the input so only the **first letter of the entire sentence** is capitalized.
- Display the converted sentence.
- Show errors for empty or invalid input.

## Example test cases

| #  | Input                          |
|-----|-------------------------------|
| 1   | `    ` (only spaces)|
| 2   | `` (empty string)|
| 3   | `HELLO WORLD`|
| 4   | `!exclamation` |
| 5   | `123abc`|
| 6   | `    multiple   SPACES`|
| 7   | `eXample INPUT with MixED CaSe!  `|
| 8   | Single character input like `"a"`|
